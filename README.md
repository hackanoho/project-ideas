# Project ideas and resources for the Hacka-noho

This is a collection of example Python code, presented as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), along with a few mini datasets.

- [basic skeleton](basic%20skeleton.ipynb) has a few pointers about using Jupyter notebooks
- [Maps.ipynb](Maps.ipynb) has an example of visualising maps and geographic information in Python.
- Data sets for Te Reo Māori usage are are in the Maori language visualisation folder
- [Environment API project.ipynb](Environment%20digitalnz%20project/Environment%20API%20project.ipynb) is a notebook setting out the steps to get data from [DigitalNZ](https://digitalnz.org/) to start you modelling how New Zealand media portray environmental issues.
- The [SMAT project.ipynb](SMAT%20api%20project/SMAT%20project.ipynb) is about using the Social Media Analysis Tool (SMAT) API to analyse conspiracy theories on social media


These are just a few ideas. Others are:

- Create a website on health and technology based on Te Whare Tapa Whā principles
- Exploring prospects for language survival using mathematical models based on a recent paper
- Working with people from Papa Reo on machine learning applied to Māori and Pacific Languages
- Working to improve the hacka-noho concept and delivery
